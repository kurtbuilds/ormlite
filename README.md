# `ormlite`

**`ormlite` is an ORM in Rust for developers that love SQL.** Let's see it in action:

```rust
use ormlite::model::*;
use ormlite::sqlite::SqliteConnection;

#[derive(Model, Debug)]
pub struct Person {
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    /// Start by making a database connection.
    let mut conn = SqliteConnection::connect(":memory:").await.unwrap();

    /// You can insert the model directly.
    let mut john = Person {
        id: 1,
        name: "John".to_string(),
        age: 99,
    }.insert(&mut conn).await?;

    println!("{:?}", john);

    /// After modifying the object, you can update all its fields.
    john.age += 1;
    john.update_all_fields(&mut conn).await?;

    /// Query builder syntax closely follows SQL syntax, translated into chained function calls.
    let people = Person::select()
        .where_("age > ?").bind(50)
        .fetch_all(&mut conn).await?;

    println!("{:?}", people);
}
```

You might like `ormlite` because:

- It auto-generates migrations from Rust structs. To my knowledge, it is the only Rust ORM with this capability.
- The join API (in alpha) has far fewer moving pieces than any other Rust ORM. It only relies on the table `struct`s themselves, and does not rely on relation traits (SeaORM) or modules (Diesel).
- There's little to no query builder syntax to learn. The query builder basically joins together &str fragments of raw SQL. It strikes the right level of abstraction between composability, and having near-zero learning curve for anyone who already knows SQL.

# Quickstart

### Installation

Install with `cargo`:

```ps
# For postgres
cargo add ormlite --features postgres
# For sqlite
cargo add ormlite --features sqlite
```

Or update your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
# For postgres
ormlite = { version = "..", features = ["postgres"] }
# For sqlite
ormlite = { version = "..", features = ["sqlite"] }
```

Other databases and runtimes are supported, but are less tested. Please submit an issue if you encounter any.


### Environment Setup

You need `DATABASE_URL` in your environment. We recommend a tool like [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), which
can pull in a `.env` file, but for simplicity, here we'll use shell directly.

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
```

### Migrations

If you are querying a static database and don't need migrations, skip this section. If you want migrations, keep reading.

First, install `ormlite-cli`. Currently, the CLI only supports Postgres. While `ormlite-cli` is separate from [`sqlx-cli`](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/master/sqlx-cli/README.md#usage), they are 100% compatible with each other.
`sqlx-cli` does not support auto-generating migrations or snapshots (to rollback in development without writing down migrations), but it is less bleeding edge and supports more database types.

```bash
cargo install ormlite-cli
```

Next, create the database and the migrations table. `init` creates a `_sqlx_migrations` table that tracks your migrations.

```bash
# Create the database if it doesn't exist. For postgres, that's:
# createdb <dbname>
ormlite init
```

Let's see migrations in action. Create a Rust struct with `#[derive(Model)]`, which the CLI tool detects to auto-generate migrations:

```
# src/models.rs

use ormlite::model::*;

#[derive(Model, Debug)]
pub struct Person {
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}
```

Next, auto-generate the migration.

```bash
ormlite migrate initial
```

This creates a plain SQL file in `migrations/`. Let's review it before we execute it:

```bash
cat migrations/*.sql
```

Once you're satisfied reviewing it, you can execute it:

```bash
ormlite up
```

By default, `up` also creates a snapshot, so you can rollback using `ormlite down` if need be. There's also an option to generate paired up/down migrations instead of only up migrations.

That's the end of setup. Let's now look at how to run queries.

# Insert & Update

The insert and update syntax at the top of the README is most effective for UUID primary key tables.

```rust
use ormlite::model::*;
use uuid::Uuid;

#[derive(Model, Debug)]
pub struct Event {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut conn = ormlite::sqlite::SqliteConnection::connect(":memory:").await.unwrap();

    let mut event = Event {
        id: Uuid::new_v4(),
        name: "user_clicked".to_string(),
    }.insert(&mut conn).await?;

    println!("{:?}", event);
}
```

This syntax has two possible issues. First, `id` is not `Option`, so it must be set,
causing problems for autoincrement id fields. Second, the struct cannot track which fields are modified, so the update
method must update all columns.

### Insertion Struct

To work around the autoincrement issue, you can use an insertion struct, shown here, or a builder, shown below.

```rust
use ormlite::types::Json;
use serde_json::Value;

#[derive(Model, Debug)]
#[ormlite(insertable = InsertPerson)]
pub struct Person {
    pub id: i32,
    // Because the other fields are the primary key, and marked as default and default_value respectively,
    // `name` is the only field in the InsertPerson struct.
    pub name: String,
    // This field will not be part of the InsertPerson struct,
    // and rows will take the database-level default upon insertion.
    #[ormlite(default)]
    pub archived_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    // This field will not be part of the InsertPerson struct, 
    // which will always pass the provided value when inserting.
    #[ormlite(default_value = "serde_json::json!({})")]
    pub metadata: Json<Value>,
}

async fn insertion_struct_example(conn: &mut SqliteConnection) {  
    let john: Person = InsertPerson {
        name: "John".to_string(),
    }.insert(&mut conn).await?;

    println!("{:?}", john);
}
```

If the derived struct doesn't meet your needs, you can manually define a struct that only contains the fields you want,
specifying `table = "<table>"` to route the struct to the same database table.

```rust
#[derive(Model, Debug)]
#[ormlite(table = "person")]
pub struct InsertPerson {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}
```

### Insert Builder & Update Builder

You can also use builder syntax for insertion or to update only certain fields.

```rust
#[derive(Model, Debug)]
pub struct Person {
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}

async fn builder_syntax_example() {    
    // builder syntax for insert
    let john = Person::builder()
        .name("John".to_string())
        .age(99)
        .insert(&mut conn).await?;

    println!("{:?}", john);

    // builder syntax for update
    let john = john.update_partial()
        .age(100)
        .update(&mut conn).await?;

    println!("{:?}", john);
}
```

# Select Query

You can use `Model::select` to build a SQL query using Rust logic.

> **Note**: Postgres's approach of using numbered dollar sign placeholders quickly breaks down when building queries. Instead, even with Postgres, use `?` for parameters,
> and `ormlite` will replace the `?` placeholders with `$` placeholders when it constructs the final query.

```rust
#[derive(Model, Debug)]
pub struct Person {
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}

async fn query_builder_example() {
    let people = Person::select()
        .where_("age > ?")
        .bind(50i32)
        .fetch_all(&mut conn)
        .await?;
    println!("All people over 50: {:?}", people); 
}
```

### Raw Query

You can fall back to raw queries if the ORM methods don't work for you. You can include handwritten strings, or if
you want a lower-level query builder, you can use [`sqlmo`](https://github.com/kurtbuilds/sqlmo),
the underlying engine that powers `ormlite`'s query builder & migration auto-generation.

```rust
async fn model_query_example() {
    // Query using the Model to still deserialize results into the struct
    let _person = Person::query("SELECT * FROM person WHERE id = ?")
        .bind(1)
        .fetch_one(&mut conn)
        .await?;
}

async fn raw_query_example() {
    // You can also use the raw query API, which will return tuples to decode as you like
    let _used_ids: Vec<i32> = ormlite::query_as("SELECT id FROM person")
        .fetch_all(pool)
        .await
        .unwrap()
        .into_iter()
        .map(|row: (i32, )| row.0)
        .collect();
}
```

# Table Customization

Attributes are defined in [these structs](https://github.com/kurtbuilds/ormlite/blob/master/attr/src/attr.rs).

This example shows them in action:

```rust
#[derive(Model, Debug)]
#[ormlite(table = "people", insertable = InsertPerson)]
pub struct Person {
    #[ormlite(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    #[ormlite(column = "name_of_column_in_db")]
    pub age: i32,
}
```

## Joins

Join support is alpha stage. Right now, `ormlite` only support many-to-one relations (e.g. Person belongs to Organization). 
Support for many-to-many and one-to-many is planned. If you use this functionality, please report any bugs you encounter.

```rust
#[derive(Model, Debug)]
pub struct Person {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
    
    // Note that we don't declare a separate field `pub organization_id: Uuid`.
    // It is implicitly defined by the Join and the join_column attribute.
    #[ormlite(join_column = "organization_id")]
    pub organization: Join<Organization>,
}

#[derive(Model, Debug)]
pub struct Organization {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Note we don't need to insert it.
    let org = Organization {
        id: Uuid::new_v4(),
        name: "Acme".to_string(),
    };
    
    let user = Person {
        id: Uuid::new_v4(),
        name: "John".to_string(),
        age: 99,
        organization: Join::new(org),
    };
    
    let mut conn = ormlite::sqlite::SqliteConnection::connect(":memory:").await.unwrap();

    let user = user.insert(&mut conn).await?;
    assert_eq!(user.organization.loaded(), true);
    println!("{:?}", user);
    
    // You can choose whether you want to load the relation or not. The value will be Join::NotQueried if you don't 
    // opt-in to loading it.
    let users = Person::select()
        .join(Person::organization())
        .fetch_all(&mut conn)
        .await?;

    for user in users {
        assert!(user.organization.loaded());
        println!("{:?}", user);
    }
}
```

# Features & Data Types

## Uuid, Chrono, & Time

If you want Uuid or DateTime, combined with serde, you need to depend directly on `uuid`, `time` or `chrono`, 
and add the `serde` feature to each of them.

```
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
uuid = { version = "...", features = ["serde"] } 
chrono = { version = "...", features = ["serde"] }
time = { version = "...", features = ["serde"] }
```

```rust
use ormlite::model::*;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use ormlite::types::Uuid;
use ormlite::types::chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

#[derive(Model, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Person {
    pub uuid: Uuid,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub name: String,
}
```

## Json/Jsonb Columns

You can use `ormlite::types::Json` for JSON or JSONB fields. For unstructured data, use `serde_json::Value` as the inner
type. Use a struct with `Deserialize + Serialize` as the generic for structured data.

```rust
use ormlite::model::*;
use ormlite::types::Json;
use serde_json::Value;

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct JobData {
    pub name: String,
}

#[derive(Model, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Job {
    pub id: i32,
    pub structured_data: Json<JobData>,
    pub unstructured_data: Json<Value>,
}
```

# Logging

You can log queries using sqlx's logger: `RUST_LOG=sqlx=info`
